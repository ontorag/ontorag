# ontorag/hub — OntoRAG Hub API
#
# GitHub-authenticated web API that orchestrates the OntoRAG pipeline.
# User data (DTOs, chunks, proposals, instances) is stored in private
# GitHub repos owned by the user.  Ontologies live centrally on our
# server and power lightweight, dynamically-generated MCP servers.
